About Tenjin
------------

Tenjin is very fast template system implemented in many programming languages.
It is similar to eRuby but has many features that eRuby doesn't have.
And It runs much faster than ERB, Smarty, Template-Tookit, Django's template
engine, and so on.


Supported Programming Languages
-------------------------------

Tenjin is now implemented in the following proguramming languages.

* Python
* Ruby
* PHP
* Perl
* JavaScript

Tenjin is the fastest template system for each programming language.


Repository and Branches
-----------------------

Tenjin is managed with Git and there are several branches for each language.
Therefore you should check out proper branch what you want.

For example, if you are Python programmer, you should check out 'python' branch
according to the following steps:

  $ git clone git://github.com/kwatch/tenjin.git
  $ cd tenjin/
  $ git checkout -b python origin/python
  $ git branch
    master
  * python
  $ cd python/

I recommend you to show branch name in your command-line propmpt at any time.
